<h1><center>Layer 3 tile data format</center></h1>
This document explains the tile format of some status bar (and overworld border plus) patches relating to writing on layer 3
background plane. Because SMW's original status bar, Ladida's SMB3 status bar and Minimalist Status Bars are different formats,
it is worth explaining how to deal with such patches.<br><br>

It is important to note that even if using SMW's status bar, each tile have their data stored in two bytes, the tile number (<kbd>TTTTTTTT</kbd>)
and its tile properties (<kbd>YXPCCCTT</kbd>):
<ul>
<li>SMW's vanilla status bar have only its tile number table stored at address <kbd>$7E0EF9</kbd> to <kbd>$7E0F2F</kbd> ([<kbd>[TTTTTTTT, TTTTTTTT, ...]</kbd>]), while the default tile number
and properties table stored at ROM address <kbd>$008C81</kbd> to <kbd>$008CFE</kbd> (<kbd>[TTTTTTTT, YXPCCCTT, TTTTTTTT, YXPCCCTT, ...]</kbd>).</li>
<li>Using the Super status bar patch, the format is the same as SMW's <kbd>$008C81-$008CFE</kbd>, but where this table is located can be customized via a define
(&ldquo;<kbd>!RAM_BAR</kbd>&rdquo;, which is currently <kbd>$7FA000</kbd> by default on a normal ROM and <kbd>$404000</kbd> by default on a SA-1 ROM).
This address ranges from <kbd>!RAM_BAR</kbd> to <kbd>!RAM_BAR+319</kbd>. The only difference is that this entire table is in RAM (can be modified in-game) and have way more customizable tiles
than SMW.</li>
</ul><br>

SMW's <kbd>$008C81-$008CFE</kbd>, SSB patch, and the OWB+ patch's tile format stores the data like this:<br>
<center><img src="SuperStatusBarOverworldBorderPlusTileFormat.png"></center><br><br>
Colored in light-red is the tile number (<kbd>TTTTTTTT</kbd>) and light-blue for tile properties (<kbd>YXPCCCTT</kbd>). Both bytes are placed next to one another as a pair for
an 8x8 tile. Therefore if you want to read or write the next tile, you move <b>2 bytes</b> over as opposed to 1. This format is when you assume the variable <kbd>TileFormat</kbd>
equals to <kbd>$02</kbd> when finding the tile write range in the formulas in the main readme file.<br><br>

Ladida's Status bar patches, however have their types be in separate tables, where moving 1 byte over means the next 8x8 tile:
<center><img src="LadidaStatusBarFormat.png"></center><br>
On this format, assume <kbd>TileFormat</kbd> is <kbd>$01</kbd> when used in a formula in the main readme file.<br><br>

Thus, loops and other codes to write to the status bar  is slightly different depending on the byte format, that you
should set <kbd>!StatusBarFormat</kbd> to <kbd>$01</kbd> for SMW/Ladida's status bar and <kbd>$02</kbd> for Super status bar/Overworld border plus. Currently, at the time of writing
this, there is no other OWB patches besides OWB+, make sure you check any future patch's tile format before making changes here.<br>

<h1>Status bar patches data locations</h1>
Note: Because patches can update, this information presented may be out of date should the format and RAM location gets changed in the future. Not to mention, the patches themselves may include
showing the address locations in the future as well.<br>
