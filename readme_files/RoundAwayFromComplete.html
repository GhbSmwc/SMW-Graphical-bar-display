<center><h1>Rounding towards &ldquo;Complete&rdquo; detection</h1></center>
<center><table><tr><td><img src="RoundingAwayComparasions.png"><br>
<div style="max-width:588px;">A comparison between not having &ldquo;rounding away&rdquo; and having rounding away when displaying values close to 0% and 100%
on a 62-pieced bar (3 pieces for both ends, and 7 middle tiles with 8 pieces each: <nobr><kbd>3+(8*7)+3</kbd></nobr>). Note when round-away was applied, the bars' fill are 1-piece off from full and empty.</div></td></tr></table></center><br>

The purpose of this rounding detection feature is to prevent the bar from misrepresenting the value of something when they get rounded down towards empty or
upwards to full (I would use the term &ldquo;complete&rdquo; for both of these). Thus, before this was implemented, when used on such things such as a health
bar, the meter can display &ldquo;empty&rdquo; when the character (player or enemy)'s actual HP isn't 0 (not defeated), due to the bar's fill value (number
of pieces filled) was calculated to be a nonzero less than 0.5, and when used as a progress meter (say, the percentage completion), the bar could
display 100% if the resulting number of pieces is at least <kbd>MaxFill-0.5</kbd> and less than <kbd>MaxFill</kbd>. This happens if the value of &ldquo;max quantity&rdquo;
is greater than the number of pieces in the bar, resulting some of the quantity values to be assigned to the same number of pieces filled:
<table><tr><td><pre>!Scratchram_GraphicalBar_LeftEndPiece:      $03
!Scratchram_GraphicalBar_MiddlePiece:       $08
!Scratchram_GraphicalBar_RightEndPiece:     $03
!Scratchram_GraphicalBar_TempLength:        $07
 
;TotalPieces: 3 + (8*7) + 3 = 62 pieces (the maximum) in the whole bar.
;!Scratchram_GraphicalBar_FillByteTbl+2: Holds the 16-bit number $00C8 (200 in decimal).
;Testing various values (16-bit) stored in !Scratchram_GraphicalBar_FillByteTbl results in these values:

0*62/200 = 0.00 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 0 (Y=$00) - A truly empty bar
<span style="color: red">1*62/200 = 0.31 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 0 (Y=$01)</span>
2*62/200 = 0.62 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 1 (Y=$00)
3*62/200 = 0.93 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 1 (Y=$00)
4*62/200 = 1.24 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 1 (Y=$00)
;...
195*62/200 = 60.45 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 60 (Y=$00)
196*62/200 = 60.76 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 61 (Y=$00)
197*62/200 = 61.07 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 61 (Y=$00)
198*62/200 = 61.38 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 61 (Y=$00)
<span style="color: red">199*62/200 = 61.69 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 62 (Y=$02)</span>
200*62/200 = 62.00 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 62 (Y=$00) - A truly full bar
201*62/200 = 62.31 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 62 (Y=$00)
202*62/200 = 62.62 pieces filled &rightarrow; round to 63 (Y=$00) - will still display 62/62 in the table (capped), but filled amount is still 63.</pre></td></tr></table><br>

You may wondering why I rather have the information about the rounding towards empty or full (best to be called &ldquo;complete&rdquo;
for both empty and full) to be as an output of <kbd>CalculateGraphicalBarPercentage</kbd> subroutine in Y than directly have $00 (amount of fill) set to #$0001 (the fill
amount is 16-bit) or <kbd>AllPieces-1</kbd> be in the routine. This is in case if you want to have <i>certain</i> bar(s) with the rounding <i>away</i> from either full or empty (say a percent
completion bar ALLOWS rounding down to 0%, but forbids rounding up to 100% when 99.99%, while the HP bar is the other way around). These subroutines will automatically perform the round-away for you:
<table><tr><td><pre>JSL GraphicalBarELITE_RoundAwayEmpty			;>Rounds to 1 if attempts to round down to 0.
JSL GraphicalBarELITE_RoundAwayFull			;>Rounds to MaxFill-1 if attempts to round up to MaxFill.
JSL GraphicalBarELITE_RoundAwayEmptyFull		;>Rounds to 1 if attempts to round down to 0 AND rounds to MaxFill-1 if attempts to round up to MaxFill.</pre></td></tr></table>
